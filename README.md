KNN

This Smarket dataset consists of percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1, 250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005. For each date, we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, Lag1 through Lag5. We have also recorded Volume (the number of shares traded, in Billions). Today (the percentage return on the date in question) and Direction (whether the market was Up or Down on this date).

As we discussed today, we can create more features when dealing with time series data (Day of the Month, Month of the year etc.). Again as always, do your exploratory anlaysis visually.
